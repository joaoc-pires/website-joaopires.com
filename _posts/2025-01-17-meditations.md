**Title**: Meditations<br>
**Author**: Marcus Aurelius<br>
**Year**: 1558

## **What is it about?** 
These are the First Citizen's thoughts on how to live life using the principles of Stoicism. Marcus Aurelius writes about how to live in a tranquil way and how to treat others.

## **Key takeaways** 
The Universe is indifferent, and we will encounter difficulties throughout life. The best way to face these difficulties is to be mentally prepared for when they happen. Live life with compassion, and don't expect from others something they can't give you, because often they are as lost, or more, than you. You will die one day, be aware of this so as not to put off until later what you can do now. Accept the Universe as it is, not as you would like it to be.

## **Best Quotes**
>"You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."

>"The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts."

>"Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth."

>"Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one."

>"If someone is able to show me that what I think or do is not right, I will happily change, for I seek the truth, by which no one was ever truly harmed. It is the person who continues in his self-deception and ignorance who is harmed."

>"If it is not right do not do it; if it is not true do not say it."

>"What we do today, echoes in eternity."

## **Would I recommend it?** 
Yes. The book was not written as a book, this is historically known, and obvious when you read it. It is clearly just the Emperor's thoughts, like in a personal journal, hence why the book repeats a lot of ideas and thoughts. Nevertheless, the message it conveys is quite valid, in my opinion.

**Notes**: I've read this book because I was on a personal journey to understand Stoicism, both in relation to 'cognitive behaviour therapy', as well as politics.
