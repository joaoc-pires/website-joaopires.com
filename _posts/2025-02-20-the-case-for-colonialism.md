**Article**: The Case for Colonialism<br>
**Author**: Bruce Gilley<br>
**Year**: 2018

### Thoughts and Ideas
In this article, the author presents a direct and unapologetic critique of anticolonialism. He argues that colonialism had a positive civilizational impact and that anticolonial movements ultimately hindered the progress of former European colonies. To support his claims, he provides structured examples illustrating how aspects of colonial rule benefited self-governance in post-colonial states.

Gilley identifies three fundamental flaws in anti-colonial arguments:

That colonialism was objectively harmful.
That it was subjectively illegitimate.
That it offends modern sensibilities.
To counter the first argument, Gilley highlights former colonies that preserved colonial institutions to strengthen their governance, reinforcing his thesis that colonialism had a civilizing effect. He further argues that colonized populations often supported and cooperated with the colonizing powers. This ties into his second point on legitimacy—he asserts that both local leaders and the general population conferred legitimacy on colonial rule.

Finally, he challenges the claim that colonialism is offensive to modern sensibilities by citing contemporary examples that parallel colonial structures, such as the Port of Jakarta, the Solomon Islands, and Sierra Leone.

While Gilley’s arguments are well-structured, there seems to be a critical gap in his reasoning. The issue, arguably, was not just poor colonial governance (though it undeniably existed) but also the failures of decolonization. His argument appears selective, relying on cherry-picked examples to support his thesis, making it ultimately unconvincing.

**Notes**: I've read this paper as a sugestion by the professor of the 'History of Modern Colonisation and Decolonisation' course during the Ba in International Relations.
