### Thoughts and Ideas
Plato has a pessimistic view of the progression of political regimes. His thesis can be summarized in three key points:

1. Political regimes are in a constant state of degeneration.
2. The primary moderators of a regime’s degeneration are the quality of education and the erosion of values and social structure.
3. A just society, in order to remain just, must create a separation of classes based on the abilities of its citizens.

When these key moderators fail, individuals without the proper vocation begin to rise to positions of power, which is the main cause of a regime’s decline. The first stage of this decline leads to a Timocracy, where leadership is no longer in the hands of the best, but rather those who are lovers of honor and war. If the underlying issues remain unaddressed, the regime further degenerates into an Oligarchy, where the wealthy rule to maintain and expand their wealth. The process of decline continues into Democracy, where governance serves only the self-interest of the people, and excessive freedom and equality prevail. This unchecked degeneration ultimately leads to a loss of confidence in the system and the rise of Demagogues, who promise the masses what they want to hear.

Eventually, among these demagogues, one emerges with the courage to tell the people what they already suspect—that the regime has rotted from within. These bold demagogues are elevated to the status of Leader. However, due to the very way they rise to power, such a demagogue possesses the nature of a Tyrant. This nature often leads to their initial exile, but this is only temporary, as their removal does not fix the structural decay of the regime.

In time, the demagogue returns to the Polis and once again seeks to become the Leader. At this point, they either meet death at the hands of their opponents or achieve absolute power. By this stage, their transformation into a Tyrant is complete. They eliminate opposition and begin raising taxes to burden the population with concerns over their own survival, thereby weakening any resistance.

Next, they create the necessity for war, ensuring that the people remain in need of a strong leader. The tyrant, now firmly in power, lives in constant fear, surrounding themselves with despicable individuals and maintaining a permanent guard, as they are consumed by irrational desires—symptoms of the regime’s complete degeneration. The people, in turn, are reduced to mere subjects, treated as slaves.

Plato does not foresee a return to Kallipolis (the ideal state).
