**Article**: Idealist internationalism and the security dilemma<br>
**Author**: John Herz<br>
**Year**: 1950

### Thoughts and Ideas

This paper explores the historical struggle of human societies with the security dilemma—the persistent tension between power politics and utopian Political Idealism. It examines how, in an anarchic international system, states and groups seeking to enhance their security inadvertently generate insecurity for others, fueling cycles of tension and competition even in the absence of aggressive intentions.

The introduction outlines the paper’s focus on the security dilemma as a fundamental social dynamic, where interconnected groups coexist without a unifying higher authority, leading to perpetual concerns over security and power competition. It also contrasts Political Realism and Political Idealism, analyzing their influence on social and political movements over time.

Key themes of the paper include:

* The enduring relevance of the security dilemma, highlighting how structural conditions, rather than malicious intent, often drive conflict.
* The necessity of balancing ethical ideals with natural forces, advocating for restraint and peace as counterweights to the cosmic struggle for existence.
* The potential of Realist Liberalism, a synthesis of Political Realism’s pragmatic insights and Political Idealism’s aspirations, as a more sustainable path toward human freedom.

By bridging Realism and Idealism, the paper argues for a nuanced approach that acknowledges both the constraints of power politics and the transformative potential of ethical governance.
