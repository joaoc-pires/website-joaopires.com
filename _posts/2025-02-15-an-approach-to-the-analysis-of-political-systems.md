**Article**: An approach to the analysis of Political Systems<br>
**Author**: David Easton<br>
**Year**: 1957

### Thoughts and Ideas
In this foundational work, the author analyzes political systems through the lens of systems theory. For David Easton, a Political System is any system that produces political decisions of various kinds. This system operates within an environment that influences it through supports or demands (inputs), which, once processed by the system, generate decisions or policies (outputs). These outputs, in turn, act as stimuli for other systems in the surrounding environment, triggering new inputs for the political system under analysis.

A political system is entropic when it progressively loses the ability to process inputs and generate effective outputs that respond to the demands of its environment. This failure creates a negative feedback loop in which increasing demands and decreasing support further weaken the systemâ€™s functionality. When the system can no longer adapt or produce outputs that sustain its own stability, it reaches a state of maximum entropy, becoming dysfunctional and facing either collapse or radical transformation.

**Notes**: I've read this article as a sugestion by the 'Theories of International Relations' course and 'International Politics' course professors during the Ba in International Relations.
