**Article**: The Geographical Pivot of History<br>
**Author**: Halford J. Mackinder<br>
**Year**: 1904

### Thoughts and Ideas
The author predicts that in the new, post-Columbian era, all explosions of social forces will echo across the globe, rather than dissipating due to lack of contact. This thesis, although seemingly plausible at first glance, ignores the fact that this is not something new. The event that gave rise to the so-called Columbian era - discoveries - was kicked of due to the fall of Constantinople which cut Europe off from trade with the East, the Schism of the Western Catholic Church and the Reformation which put the Church of Rome at risk, and the technological advances made by Islam that made their way to the Iberian Peninsula.

The author argues that modern Europe was born due to the pressures caused by invasions from Asia. The way the author writes seems to imply that Europe is an inevitable consequence of these invasions, an almost deterministic argument. This thesis ignores that Europe could have been very different if the Umayyads had not been defeated at the Battle of Tours in 732 or the Ottomans at the Siege of Vienna in 1638.

Jared Diamond's thesis, in "Guns, Germs and Steel" is much more complete, mainly in the deterministic sense of the European domination of the Globe and how Geography, but also Biology and the political characteristics of the continent drove the European exploration of the globe.

**Notes**: I've read this paper as a 'Human Geography' course assignment during the Ba in International Relations.
