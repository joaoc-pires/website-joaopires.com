**Title**: The Prince<br>
**Author**: Niccolò Machiavelli<br>
**Year**: 1532

### **What is it about?**
The Prince is a political treatise by Niccolò Machiavelli, written in the early 16th century, offering a pragmatic and often ruthless guide to power. It focuses on how rulers can maintain control, navigate political instability, and handle both allies and enemies. It departs from idealistic visions of governance and instead embraces a realistic, sometimes cynical, view of power, advocating for deception, manipulation, and even cruelty when necessary. It is often regarded as the foundation of Classical Political Realism.

### **Thoughts and Ideas**
The book is a masterpiece of political theory, stripping away the moralistic approach to governance and exposing the raw mechanics of power. Machiavelli's realism is what makes The Prince timeless—he acknowledges that rulers must often choose between what is morally right and what is politically effective. His emphasis on adaptability, the use of fear over love when necessary, and the role of fortune in politics are especially compelling. While many have labeled the book as cynical or even immoral, I see it as brutally honest; it does not advocate tyranny but rather explains how power actually functions.

### **Best Quotes**
> "It is better to be feared than loved, if you cannot be both."

> "A wise prince ought never to keep faith when by doing so it would be against his interests."

> "Men are so simple, and so much creatures of circumstance, that he who seeks to deceive will always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived."

> "He who wishes to be obeyed must know how to command."

### **Would I recommend it?**
Absolutely. The Prince is essential reading for anyone interested in political theory, international relations, or leadership. It remains relevant today, especially in understanding realpolitik, diplomacy, and power dynamics in any hierarchical system. While it may not provide an ethical guide to governance, it offers an invaluable lens through which to analyze politics as it actually works.

**Notes**: I've read this book for the first time when trying to understand if I wanted to study International Relations, and again as an assignment for the 'Political Theory' course during the Ba in International Relations.
